# Multi-Domain Research Agent

A multi-agent research application built with OpenAI's Agents SDK and Streamlit. This application empowers users to perform in-depth research across multiple domains by utilizing specialized AI agents tailored to different fields of study.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**:
  - **Triage Agent**: Evaluates the research query and assigns it to the appropriate domain-specific agent.
  - **Domain-Specific Agents**: Dedicated agents for various domains (e.g., Computer Science, Biology, General Research) that perform targeted research.

- **Automatic Fact Collection**: Extracts key facts from research with proper source attribution.
- **Structured Report Generation**: Produces well-organized reports including titles, abstracts, domain details, citations, and comprehensive findings.
- **Interactive UI**: Powered by Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for submitting research queries and reviewing results.

## How to Get Started

### 1. Clone the GitHub Repository

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jenilsoni-ai/master-ai-agents.git
cd master-ai-agents/openai-agents-sdk/beginner/multi-domain-research-agent
```
